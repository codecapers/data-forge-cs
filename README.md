# data-forge

C# data transformation and analysis toolkit inspired by Pandas and LINQ.

Designed to work under .Net 3.5 so that it can be used with the [Unity game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)).

[Also available for JavaScript](https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games/data-forge-js).

The JavaScript versions is far more advanced the than C# version. Please check there to see where we are at.

This project is a work in progress, please don't use unless you want to be an early adopter. Please expect API changes. Please contribute and help guide the direction of *data-forge*.

## Project Aims

The aims of this project:

- To combine the best aspects of [Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)) and [LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query) and make them available in JavaScript and C#.
- To be able to load data, transform and save data.
- To be able to prepare data for visualization. 

## Driving Principles 

The principles that drive decision making and tradeoffs:

- Simple, easy to learn, easy to use.
- High performance.
- Be able to use the same (or very similar) API in both Javascript and C#.

## Implementation

General implementation goals:

- Immutable, every operation generates a new immutable data set.
- Lazy evaluation, to make the performance of immutability acceptable.
- To support different data sources and formats via plugins.
