# data-forge

C# data transformation and analysis toolkit inspired by Pandas and LINQ.

[Also available for Javascript](https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games/data-forge-js).

----------

This is a work in progress, please don't use unless you want to be an early adopter. Please expect API changes. Please contribute and help guide the direction of data-forge.

## Project Aims

The aims of this project. 

- To combine the best aspects of [Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)) and [LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query) and make them available in Javascript and C#.
- To be able to load data, transform and save data.
- To be able to prepare data for visualization. 

## Driving Principles 

The principles that drive decision making and tradeoffs.

- Simple, easy to learn, easy to use.
- High performance.
- Be able to use the same (or very similar API in both Javascript and C#).

## Implementation

Specific implementation details.

- Immutable, every operation generates a new immutable data set.
- Lazy evaluation, to make the performance of immutability acceptable.
- To support different data sources and formats via plugins.

The rest of the README defines what we want to achieve with data-forge. Certain features described are not implemented yet.
